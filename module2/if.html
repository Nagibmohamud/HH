<h1>If &#88212;</h1> 
<h2>Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936)</h2>


<p>
If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
 But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
  Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
</p>
<p>
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,<br>
And breaths were gathering sure<br>
For that last onset, when the King<br>
Be witnessed in his power.
</p>
<p>
I willed my keepsakes, signed away<br>
What portion of me I<br>
Could make assignable &#8212; and then<br>
There interposed a fly,
</p>
<p>
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz<br>
Between the light and me;<br>
And then the windows failed &#8212; and then<br>
I could not see to see.
</p>
