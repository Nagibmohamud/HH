<h1>If</h1> 
<h2>Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936)</h2>

<p>
If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
 But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
  Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
</p>
<p>
[..]<br>
<br>
  If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
  With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   <br>
  And&#8212;which is more&#8212;you’ll be a Man, my son!
</p>
