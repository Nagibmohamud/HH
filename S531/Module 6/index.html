            <h2>What did Nagib used to do?</h2>
    
        <p>Nagib used to spend his whole free time outside with his friends who lived in the neighbourhood. He was so long outside that his parents use to get mad that he didn't come back home to eat anything. The first picture was his playground where he use to be playing football and all kinds of games as a kid with his friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then there came a time where Nagib moved out of his house to another place. There was a store next to his school where everyone would go to after school. According to Nagib he said the most memorable moments with his friends were near the store</p>
